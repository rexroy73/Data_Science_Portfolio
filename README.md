# Data_Science_Portfolio
All data science work done has been added here.

#spam_detector
This is a very simple spam detector. Pre processed data is used to load as dataset and the accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier and Adaboost classifier is compared.

#spam_detector2
1. This is an sms spam detector with data set downloaded from kaggle. The data taken is raw and is pre processed using sklearn library and then fitted using Naive bayes classifier, using different feature extraction methods - CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.
2. The feature extraction method CountVectorizer gives more accuracy in both test and train set. Hence it has been used. 
3. Further, data visualization has been carried out to see the most frequent words for both spam and non-spam messages. 
4. Then basic analysis is carried out --- the model prediction is checked and the messages that are predicted wrong are printed.
