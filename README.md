# Data_Science_Portfolio

1. Spam detector with already processed data naive bayes and Adaboost, comparing which performs better.
2. Spam detector with raw data using Naive bayes
3. Sentiment Analyzer takes in the Amazon reviews(in xml format) and finds how positive or negative the review is using Logistic regression, here scrapping is done using BeautifulSoup.

All my data science work done are being added here and will keep adding more as I keep learning more.
