# Data_Science_Portfolio

[1] PYTHON PROJECTS
1. Spam detector with already processed data naive bayes and Adaboost, comparing which performs better.
2. Spam detector with raw data using Naive bayes
3. Sentiment Analyzer takes in the Amazon reviews(in xml format) and finds how positive or negative the review is using Logistic regression, here scrapping is done using BeautifulSoup.

[2] R PROJECTS
1. Soc_neuralnet project predicts the State of charge(SOC) of a battery given its open circuit voltage. This project was a part of an IOT project which remotely reads voltage of a battery and sends it to a dsp processor which evaluates its SOC using supervised deep learning technique ie neural network(ANN). This predicted SOC value can be used for monitoring the health of the battery and mitigate risks. 

All my data science work done are being added here and will keep adding more as I keep learning more.
